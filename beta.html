         <p><a class ='button button-blue' href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfP0KorjW2MVFR5H7HGfBySzz1LQ6t0_FHZN7FZmoCLY5PVXQ/viewform" target="_blank">Beta Signup</a></p>
        <p><b>
          More Detailed Instructions!</b>
        </p>
         <p>
         You'll receive an email to install the "Test Flight" app (Apple's beta testing software). Install the Test Flight app and follow the instructions. It will install the Crossword Countdown app on your phone. Make sure to <b>enable notifications in Test Flight</b> so you can be notified of updates to the app as I release them.

          I'm looking for feedback in two groups:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Something is broken:</b> A page doesn't load properly, the app crashes, a button is partly off screen, text is cutoff, etc.
          </li>
          <li><b>Suggestions to make it better:</b> Is something confusing? Would you alter buttons? Are the puzzles too hard or easy? Etc.
          </li>
        </ol>

<p><b>You can send any feedback</b> to me at <a href="mailto:dan.drabik@gmail.com">dan.drabik@gmail.com</a> or through the Test Flight app (which includes helpful device information).</p>

<p>Thanks, and hope you like it!</p>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Daniel Charles Drabik III</p>
<p>P.S. Note, this is an iPhone game, so, shockingly, it requires that you have an iPhone.</p>
